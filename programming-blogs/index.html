So here's a list of some things you might want to read, and why you might (or might not) want to read them.</p> <h4 id=aleksey-shipilev-https-shipilev-net><a href=https://shipilev.net/ >Aleksey Shipilev</a></h4> <p>If you want to understand how the JVM really works, this is one of the best resources on the internet.</p> <h4 id=bruce-dawson-https-randomascii-wordpress-com><a href=https://randomascii.wordpress.com/ >Bruce Dawson</a></h4> <p>Performance explorations of a Windows programmer. Often implicitly has nice demonstrations of tooling that has no publicly available peer on Linux.</p> <h4 id=chip-huyen-https-huyenchip-com-blog><a href=https://huyenchip.com/blog/ >Chip Huyen</a></h4> <p>A mix of summaries of ML conferences, data analyses (e.g., <a href=https://huyenchip.com/2019/08/21/glassdoor-interview-reviews-tech-hiring-cultures.html>on interview data posted to glassdoor</a> or <a href=https://huyenchip.com/2020/01/18/tech-workers-19k-compensation-details.html>compensation data posted to levels.fyi</a>), and generaly commentary on the industry.</p> <p>One of the rare blogs that has data-driven position pieces about the industry.</p> <h4 id=chris-fenton-http-www-chrisfenton-com><a href=http://www.chrisfenton.com/ >Chris Fenton</a></h4> <p>Computer related projects, by which I mean things like <a href=http://www.chrisfenton.com/homebrew-cray-1a/ >reconstructing the Cray-1A</a> and <a href=http://www.chrisfenton.com/the-numbotron/ >building mechanical computers</a>. Rarely updated, presumably due to the amount of work that goes into the creations, but almost always interesting.</p> <p>The blog posts tend to be high-level, more like pitch decks than design docs, but there's often source code available if you want more detail.</p> <h4 id=cindy-sridharan-https-twitter-com-copyconstruct><a href=https://twitter.com/copyconstruct>Cindy Sridharan</a></h4> <p>More active on Twitter than on her blog, but has posts that review papers as well as some on &quot;big&quot; topics, like <a href=https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/distributed-tracing-weve-been-doing-it-wrong-39fc92a857df>distributed tracing</a> and <a href=https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/testing-in-production-the-hard-parts-3f06cefaf592>testing in production</a>.</p> <h4 id=dan-mckinley-http-mcfunley-com><a href=http://mcfunley.com/ >Dan McKinley</a></h4> <p>A lot of great material on how engineering companies should be run. He has a lot of ideas that sound like common sense, e.g., <a href=http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology>choose boring technology</a>, until you realize that it's actually uncommon to find opinions that are so sensible.</p> <p>Mostly distilled wisdom (as opposed to, say, detailed explanations of code).</p> <h4 id=eli-bendersky-http-eli-thegreenplace-net-archives-all><a href=http://eli.thegreenplace.net/archives/all>Eli Bendersky</a></h4> <p>I think of this as “<a href=http://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/c-c>the C++ blog</a>”, but it's much wider ranging that that. It's too wide ranging for me to sum up, but if I had to commit to a description I might say that it's a collection of deep dives into various topics, often (but not always) relatively low-level, along with short blurbs about books, often (but not always) technical.</p> <p>The book reviews tend to be easy reading, but the programming blog posts are often a mix of code and exposition that really demands your attention; usually not a light read.</p> <h4 id=erik-sink-https-ericsink-com-index-html><a href=https://ericsink.com/index.html>Erik Sink</a></h4> <p>I think Erik has been <a href=https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1340059909090549761>the most consistently insightful writer about tech culture over the past 20 years</a>. If you look at people who were blogging back when he started blogging, much of <a href=https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1336499111789436931>Steve Yegge's</a> writing holds up as well as Erik's, but Steve hasn't continued writing consistently.</p> <p>If you look at popular writers from that era, I think they generally tend to <a href=https://twitter.com/danluu/status/784929052519837696>not</a> <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20210912095555/https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1413996396814823431>really</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1172593136503160832>hold</a> up very well.</p> <h4 id=fabian-giesen-https-fgiesen-wordpress-com><a href=https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/ >Fabian Giesen</a></h4> <p>Covers a wide variety of technical topics. Emphasis on computer architecture, compression, graphics, and signal processing, but you'll find many other topics as well.</p> <p>Posts tend towards being technically intense and not light reading and they usually explain concepts or ideas (as opposed to taking sides and writing opinion pieces).</p> <h4 id=fabien-sanglard-http-fabiensanglard-net><a href=http://fabiensanglard.net/ >Fabien Sanglard</a></h4> <p>In depth techincal dives on game related topics, such as <a href=http://fabiensanglard.net/doomIphone/doomClassicRenderer.php>this readthrough of the Doom source code</a>, <a href=http://fabiensanglard.net/cuda/index.html>this history of Nvidia GPU architecture</a>, or <a href=http://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/index.php>this read of a business card raytracer</a>.</p> <h4 id=fabrice-bellard-http-bellard-org><a href=http://bellard.org/ >Fabrice Bellard</a></h4> <p>Not exactly a blog, but every time a new project appears on the front page, it's amazing. Some examples are QEMU, FFMPEG, a 4G LTE base station that runs on a PC, <a href=http://bellard.org/jslinux/ >a JavaScript PC emulator that can boot Linux</a>, etc.</p> <h4 id=fred-akalin-https-www-akalin-com><a href=https://www.akalin.com/ >Fred Akalin</a></h4> <p>Explanations of CS-related math topics (with a few that aren't directly CS related).</p> <h4 id=gary-bernhardt-https-twitter-com-garybernhardt><a href=https://twitter.com/garybernhardt>Gary Bernhardt</a></h4> <p>Another “not exactly a blog”, but it's more informative than most blogs, not to mention more entertaining. This is the best “blog” on <a href=https://twitter.com/garybernhardt/status/676560697262604288>the pervasive brokenness of modern software</a> that I know of.</p> <h4 id=jaana-dogan-https-rakyll-org><a href=https://rakyll.org/ >Jaana Dogan</a></h4> <p><a href=https://rakyll.org/ >rakyll.org</a> has posts on Go, some of which are quite in depth, e.g., <a href=https://rakyll.org/generics-proposal/ >this set of notes on the Go generics proposal</a> and <a href=https://medium.com/@rakyll>Jaana's medium blog</a> has some posts on Go as well as posts on various topics in distributed systems.</p> <p>Also, <a href=https://twitter.com/rakyll>Jaana's Twitter</a> has what I think of as &quot;intellectually honest critiques of the industry&quot;, which I think is unusual for critiques of the industry on Twitter. It's more typical to see people scoring points at the expense of nuance or even being vaugely in the vicinity of correctness, which is why I think it's worth calling out these honest critiques.</p> <h4 id=jamie-brandon-https-scattered-thoughts-net><a href=https://scattered-thoughts.net/ >Jamie Brandon</a></h4> <p>I'm so happy that I managed to convince Jamie that, given his preferences, it would make sense to take a crack at blogging full-time to support himself. Since <a href=https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1354239729483407360>Jamie started taking donations</a> until today, this blog has been an absolute power house with posts like <a href=https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/select-wat-from-sql/ >this</a> <a href=https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/against-sql>series</a> on problems with SQL, <a href=https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/an-opinionated-map-of-incremental-and-streaming-systems/ >this</a> <a href=https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/internal-consistency-in-streaming-systems/ >series</a> <a href=https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/why-query-planning-for-streaming-systems-is-hard>on</a> streaming systems, great work on technical projects like <a href=https://github.com/jamii/dida>dida</a> and <a href=https://github.com/jamii/imp>imp</a>, etc.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether or not Jamie will be able to convince me to try blogging as a full-time job.</p> <h4 id=janet-davis-http-blogs-whitman-edu-countingfromzero><a href=http://blogs.whitman.edu/countingfromzero/ >Janet Davis</a></h4> <p>This is the story of how a professor moved from Grinnel to Whitman and <a href=http://blogs.whitman.edu/countingfromzero/2015/07/22/how-i-got-here/ >started a CS program from scratch</a>. The archives are great reading if you're interested in how organizations form or CS education.</p> <h4 id=jeff-preshing-https-preshing-com><a href=https://preshing.com/ >Jeff Preshing</a></h4> <p>Mostly technical content relating to C++ and Python, but also includes topics that are generally useful for programmers, such as <a href=https://preshing.com/20150402/you-can-do-any-kind-of-atomic-read-modify-write-operation/ >read-modify-write operations</a>, <a href=https://preshing.com/20121105/arithmetic-encoding-using-fixed-point-math/ >fixed-point math</a>, and <a href=https://preshing.com/20120930/weak-vs-strong-memory-models/ >memory models</a>.</p> <h4 id=jessica-kerr-http-blog-jessitron-com><a href=http://blog.jessitron.com/ >Jessica Kerr</a></h4> <p>Jessica is probably better known for <a href=http://jessitron.com/talks.html>her talks</a> than her blog? Her talks are great! My favorite is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhguOt863nw">this talk with explains different concurrency models in an easy to understand way</a>, but <a href=http://blog.jessitron.com/2015/01/systems-thinking-about-wit.html>the blog also has a lot of material I like</a>.</p> <p>As is the case with her talks, the diagrams often take a concept and clarify it, making something that wasn't obvious seem very obvious in retrospect.</p> <h4 id=john-regehr-http-blog-regehr-org><a href=http://blog.regehr.org/ >John Regehr</a></h4> <p>I think of this as the <a href=http://blog.regehr.org/archives/213>“C is harder than you think, even if you think C is really hard” blog</a>, although the blog actually covers a lot more than that. Some commonly covered topics are fuzzing, compiler optimization, and testing in general.</p> <p>Posts tend to be conceptual. When there are code examples, they're often pretty easy to read, but there are also examples of bizzaro behavior that won't be easy to skim unless you're someone who knows the C standard by heart.</p> <h4 id=juho-snellman-https-www-snellman-net-blog><a href=https://www.snellman.net/blog/ >Juho Snellman</a></h4> <p>A lot of <a href=https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2015-08-25-tcp-optimization-in-mobile-networks/ >posts about networking</a>, generally <a href=https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2016-02-01-tcp-rst/ >written so that they make sense even with minimal networking background</a>. I wish more people with this kind of knowledge (in depth knowledge of systems, not just networking knowledge in particular) would write up explanations for a general audience. Also has interesting non-networking content, like <a href=https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2015-05-11-okcupid-for-voting-the-finnish-election-engines/ >this post on Finnish elections</a>.</p> <h4 id=julia-evans-http-jvns-ca><a href=http://jvns.ca/ >Julia Evans</a></h4> <p>AFAICT, the theme is “things Julia has learned recently”, which can be anything from <a href=http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/02/22/how-gzip-uses-huffman-coding/ >Huffman coding</a> to <a href=http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/10/22/working-remote-8-months-in/ >how to be happy when working in a remote job</a>. When the posts are on a topic I don't already know, I learn something new. When they're on a topic I know, they remind me that the topic is exciting and contains a lot of wonder and mystery.</p> <p>Many posts have more questions than answers, and are more of a live-blogged exploration of a topic than an explanation of the topic.</p> <h4 id=karla-burnett-https-karla-io><a href=https://karla.io/ >Karla Burnett</a></h4> <p>A mix of security-related topics and explanations of practical programming knowledge. <a href=https://karla.io/files/ichthyology-wp.pdf>This article on phishing</a>, which includes a set of fun case studies on how effective phising can be, even after people take anti-phishing training, is an example of a security post. <a href=https://karla.io/2016/06/13/dont-panic.html>This post on printing out text via tracert</a>. This <a href=https://karla.io/2016/04/30/ssh-for-fun-and-profit.html>post on writing an SSH client</a> and <a href=https://karla.io/2015/06/28/brain-teaser-2.html>this post</a> on <a href=https://karla.io/2015/06/28/brain-teaser-2.html>some coreutils puzzles</a> are examples of practical programming explanations.</p> <p>Although the blog is security oriented, posts are written for a general audience and don't assume specific expertise in security.</p> <h4 id=kate-murphy-https-kate-io><a href=https://kate.io/ >Kate Murphy</a></h4> <p>Mostly small, self-contained explorations like, <a href=https://kate.io/blog/2017/08/22/weird-python-integers/ >what's up with this Python integer behavior</a>, <a href=https://kate.io/blog/making-your-own-exploding-git-repos/ >how do you make a git blow up with a simple repo</a>, or <a href=https://kate.io/blog/simple-hash-collisions-in-lua/ >how do you generate hash collisions in Lua</a>?</p> <h4 id=kavya-joshi>Kavya Joshi</h4> <p>I generally prefer technical explanations in text over video, but her exposition is so clear that I'm putting these talks in this list of blogs. Some examples include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5erqWdlhQLA">an explanation of the go race detector</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivss-VtmbDY">simple math that's handy for performance modeling</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRvj8PykSc4">time</a>.</p> <h4 id=kyle-kingsbury-https-aphyr-com><a href=https://aphyr.com/ >Kyle Kingsbury</a></h4> <p>90% of Kyle's posts are explanations of <a href=https://aphyr.com/posts/322-call-me-maybe-mongodb-stale-reads>distributed systems testing, which expose bugs in real systems that most of us rely on</a>. The other 10% are <a href=https://aphyr.com/posts/319-clojure-from-the-ground-up-debugging>musings on programming that are as rigorous as Kyle's posts on distributed systems</a>. Possibly the most educational programming blog of all time.</p> <p>For those of us without a distributed systems background, understanding posts often requires a bit of Googling, despite the extensive explanations in the posts. Most new posts are now at <a href=http://jepsen.io/ >jepsen.io</a></p> <h4 id=laura-lindzey-https-lindzey-github-io-index-html><a href=https://lindzey.github.io/index.html>Laura Lindzey</a></h4> <p>Very infrequently updated (on the order of once a year) with explanations of things Laura has been working on, from <a href=https://lindzey.github.io/blog/2019/11/26/origami-butterfly/ >Oragami PCB</a> to <a href=https://lindzey.github.io/blog/2015/07/27/a-brief-introduction-to-ice-penetrating-radar/ >Ice-Penetrating Radar</a>.</p> <h4 id=laurie-tratt-https-tratt-net-laurie-blog><a href=https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/ >Laurie Tratt</a></h4> <p>This blog has been going since 2004 and its changed over the years. Recently, it's had some of the best posts on benchmarking around:</p> <ul> <li><a href=https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/why_arent_more_users_more_happy_with_our_vms_part_1.html>VM performance, part 1</a> <ul> <li>Thoroughly refutes the idea that you can run a language VM for some warmup period and then take some numbers when they become stable</li> </ul></li> <li><a href=https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/why_arent_more_users_more_happy_with_our_vms_part_2.html>VM performance, part 2</a></li> <li><a href=https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/minimum_times_tend_to_mislead_when_benchmarking.html>Why not use minimum times when benchmarking</a> <ul> <li>&quot;Everyone&quot; who's serious about performance knows this and it's generally considered too obvious to write up, but this is still a widely used technique in benchmarking even though it's only appropriate in limited circumstances</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>The blog isn't purely technical, <a href=https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/alternative_sources_of_advice.html>this blog post on advice is also stellar</a>. If those posts don't sound interesting to you, it's worth <a href=https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/archive.html>checking out the archives</a> to see if some of the topics Lawrence used to write about more frequently are to your taste.</p> <h4 id=marc-brooker-https-brooker-co-za-blog><a href=https://brooker.co.za/blog/ >Marc Brooker</a></h4> <p>A mix of <a href=https://brooker.co.za/blog/2012/01/17/two-random.html>theory</a> and <a href=https://brooker.co.za/blog/2016/01/03/correlation.html>wisdom</a> from a distributed systems engineer on EBS at Amazon. The theory posts tend to be relatively short and easy to swallow; not at all intimidating, as theory sometimes is.</p> <h4 id=marek-majkowski-https-idea-popcount-org><a href=https://idea.popcount.org/ >Marek Majkowski</a></h4> <p>This used to be a blog about random experiments Marek was doing, <a href=https://idea.popcount.org/2013-01-30-bitsliced-siphash/ >like this post on bitsliced SipHash</a>. Since Marek joined Cloudflare, this has turned into a list of things Marek has learned while working in Cloudflare's networking stack, like <a href=https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-curious-case-of-slow-downloads/ >this story about debugging slow downloads</a>.</p> <p>Posts tend to be relatively short, but with enough technical specifics that they're not light reads.</p> <h4 id=nicole-express-https-nicole-express><a href=https://nicole.express/ >Nicole Express</a></h4> <p>Explorations on old systems, often gaming related. Some exmaples are <a href=https://nicole.express/2021/alf-2-alf-harder.html>this post on collision detection in Alf for the Sega Master System</a>, <a href=https://nicole.express/2021/composite-conflict-completed.html>this post on getting decent quality output from composite video</a>, and <a href=https://nicole.express/2020/neo-geo-cd-zee.html>this post on the Neo Geo CDZ</a>.</p> <h4 id=nikita-prokopov-https-tonsky-me><a href=https://tonsky.me/ >Nikita Prokopov</a></h4> <p>Nikita has two blogs, both on related topics. <a href=https://tonsky.me/ >The main blog</a> has long-form articles, often how about modern software is terrible. THen there's <a href=https://grumpy.website/ >grumpy.website</a>, which gives examples of software being terrible.</p> <h4 id=nitsan-wakart-http-psy-lob-saw-blogspot-com><a href=http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/ >Nitsan Wakart</a></h4> <p>More than you ever wanted to know about writing fast code for the JVM, from <a href=http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2016/03/gc-nepotism-and-linked-queues.html>GV affects data structures</a> to <a href=http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-volatile-read-suprise.html>the subtleties of volatile reads</a>.</p> <p>Posts tend to involve lots of Java code, but the takeaways are often language agnostic.</p> <h4 id=oona-raisanen-http-www-windytan-com><a href=http://www.windytan.com/ >Oona Raisanen</a></h4> <p>Adventures in signal processing. Everything from <a href=http://www.windytan.com/2016/02/barcode-recovery-using-priori.html>deblurring barcodes</a> to figuring out <a href=http://www.windytan.com/2014/02/mystery-signal-from-helicopter.html>what those signals from helicopters mean</a>. If I'd known that signals and systems could be this interesting, I would have paid more attention in class.</p> <h4 id=paul-khuong-http-www-pvk-ca><a href=http://www.pvk.ca/ >Paul Khuong</a></h4> <p><a href=http://www.pvk.ca/Blog/2013/11/22/the-weaknesses-of-sbcls-type-propagation/ >Some content on Lisp</a>, and <a href=http://www.pvk.ca/Blog/2014/04/13/k-ary-heapsort/ >some on low-level optimizations</a>, with <a href=http://www.pvk.ca/Blog/2015/06/27/linear-log-bucketing-fast-versatile-simple/ >a trend towards low-level optimizations</a>.</p> <p>Posts are usually relatively long and self-contained explanations of technical ideas with very little fluff.</p> <h4 id=rachel-kroll-http-rachelbythebay-com-w><a href=http://rachelbythebay.com/w/ >Rachel Kroll</a></h4> <p>Years of <a href=http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2015/09/07/noleap/ >debugging stories</a> from a long-time SRE, along with stories about <a href=https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2012/02/29/derailing/ >big company nonsense</a>. Many of the stories come from Lyft, Facebook, and Google.

The question is, what's driving you? What gets you working? If its just trying to show that you're good, then you won't be. It has to be something else too, or it won't get you through the concentrated decade of training it takes to get to that level.</p> <p>Look at the history of the person we're all presuming Steve Yegge is talking about. He graduated (with honors) in 1990 and started at Google in 1999. So he worked a long time before he got to the level of Google's star. When I was at Google I hung out on Sunday afternoons with a similar superstar. Nobody else was reliably there on Sunday; but he always was, so I could count on having someone to talk to. On some Sundays he came to work even when he had unquestionably legitimate reasons for not feeling well, but he still came to work. Why didn't he go home like any normal person would? It wasn't that he was trying to prove himself; he'd done that long ago. What was driving him?</p> <p>The only way I can describe it is one word: fury. What was he doing every Sunday? He was reviewing various APIs that were being proposed as standards by more junior programmers, and he was always finding things wrong with them. What he would talk about, or rather, rage about, on these Sunday afternoons was always about some idiocy or another that someone was trying make standard, and what was wrong with it, how it had to be fixed up, etc, etc. He was always in a high dudgeon over it all.</p> <p>What made him come to work when he was feeling sick and dizzy and nobody, not even Larry and Sergey with their legendary impatience, not even them, I mean nobody would have thought less of him if he had just gone home &amp; gone to sleep? He seemed to be driven, not by ambition, but by fear that if he stopped paying attention, something idiotically wrong (in his eyes) might get past him, and become the standard, and that was just unbearable, the thought made him so incoherently angry at the sheer wrongness of it, that he had to stay awake and prevent it from happening no matter how legitimately bad he was feeling at the time.</p> <p>It made me think of Paul Graham's comment: &quot;What do I mean by good people? One of the best tricks I learned during our startup was a rule for deciding who to hire. Could you describe the person as an animal?... I mean someone who takes their work a little too seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass right through professional and cross over into obsessive.</p> <p>What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who just won't take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till 4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR person who will cold-call New York Times reporters on their cell phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something is two millimeters out of place.&quot;</p> <p>I think a corollary of this characterization is that if you really want to be &quot;an animal,&quot; what you have cultivate in yourself is partly ambition, but it is partly also self-knowledge. As Paul Graham says, there are different kinds of animals. The obsessive graphic designer might be unconcerned about an API that is less than it could be, while the programming superstar might pass by, or create, a terrible graphic design without the slightest twinge of misgiving.</p> <p>Therefore, key question is: are you working on the thing you care about most? If its wrong, is it unbearable to you? Nothing but deep seated fury will propel you to the level of a superstar. Getting there hurts too much; mere desire to be good is not enough. If its not in you, its not in you. You have to be propelled by elemental wrath. Nothing less will do.</p> <p>Or it might be in you, but just not in this domain. You have to find what you care about, and not just what you care about, but what you care about violently: you can't fake it.</p> <p>(Also, if you do have it in you, you still have to choose your boss carefully. No matter how good you are, it may not be trivial to find someone you can work for. There's more to say here; but I'll have to leave it for another comment.)</p> <p>Another clarification of my assertion &quot;if you're wondering if you're good, then you're not&quot; should perhaps be said &quot;if you need reassurance from someone else that you're good, then you're not.&quot; One characteristic of these &quot;animals&quot; is that they are such obsessive perfectionists that their own internal standards so far outstrip anything that anyone else could hold them to, that no ordinary person (i.e. ordinary boss) can evaluate them. As Steve Yegge said, they don't go for interviews. They do evaluate each other -- at Google the superstars all reviewed each other's code, reportedly brutally -- but I don't think they cared about the judgments of anyone who wasn't in their circle or at their level.</p> <p>I agree with Steve Yegge's assertion that there are an enormously important (small) group of people who are just on another level, and ordinary smart hardworking people just aren't the same. Here's another way to explain why there should be a quantum jump -- perhaps I've been using this discussion to build up this idea: its the difference between people who are still trying to do well on a test administered by someone else, and the people who have found in themselves the ability to grade their own test, more carefully, with more obsessive perfectionism, than anyone else could possibly impose on them.</p> <p>School, for all it teaches, may have one bad lasting effect on people: it gives them the idea that good people get A's on tests, and better ones get A+'s on tests, and the very best get A++'s. Then you get the idea that you go out into the real world, and your boss is kind of super-professor, who takes over the grading of the test. Joel Spolsky is accepting that role, being boss as super-professor, grading his employees tests for them, telling them whether they are good.</p> <p>But the problem is that in the real world, the very most valuable, most effective people aren't the ones who are trying to get A+++'s on the test you give them. The very best people are the ones who can make up their own test with harder problems on it than you could ever think of, and you'd have to have studied for the same ten years they have to be able even to know how to grade their answers.</p> <p>That's a problem, incidentally, with the idea of a meritocracy. School gives you an idea of a ladder of merit that reaches to the top. But it can't reach all the way to the top, because someone has to measure the rungs. At the top you're not just being judged on how high you are on the ladder. You're also being judged on your ability to &quot;grade your own test&quot;; that is to say, your trustworthiness. People start asking whether you will enforce your own standards even if no one is imposing them on you. They have to! because at the top people get given jobs with the kind of responsibility where no one can possibly correct you if you screw up. I'm giving you an image of someone who is working himself sick, literally, trying grade everyone else's work. In the end there is only so much he can do, and he does want to go home and go to bed sometimes. That means he wants people under him who are not merely good, but can be trusted not to need to be graded. Somebody has to watch the watchers, and in the end, the watchers have to watch themselves.</p> </blockquote> <a class=footnote-return href=#fnref:R><sup>[return]</sup></a></li> </ol> </div> </main><nav><div class=np> <a href=concurrency-bugs/ >← Notes on concurrency bugs</a> <a href=google-sre-book/ >Google SRE book →</a> </div></nav> <footer><div class=np> <a href= >Archive</a> <a href=https://mastodon.social/@danluu>Mastodon</a> <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/danluu.com>Bluesky</a> </div> <div class=np> <a href=https://www.patreon.com/danluu>Patreon</a> <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/danluu/ >LinkedIn</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/danluu/ >Twitter</a> <a href=atom.xml>RSS</a></div></footer>
